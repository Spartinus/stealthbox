# StealthBox

Share your favorite content remotely without spoiling your home network.

StealthBox is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image, so you can install it on any linux server without polluting
it.

It embeds several applications that are configured together to automate file sharing in the cloud and download content
to your home:

- [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/), a BitTorrent client.
- [SickRage](http://sickrage.tv), an automatic shows downloader.
- [CouchPotato](http://sickrage.tv), an automatic movies downloader.
- [HeadPhones](https://github.com/rembo10/headphones), an automated music downloader.
- [FlexGet](http://flexget.com/), a multipurpose automation tool
- [Pydio](https://pyd.io/), a web application to view, edit and download files.

## Install

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8443:443 -p 8022:22 -p 6881:6881 \
  --name stealthbox \
  --restart always \
  toilal/stealthbox
```

## Username & Password

All services are installed with a `box` username and a randomly generated password. This password is displayed when
container is starting.

To retrieve the generated password, you can use `docker logs`:

```
docker logs stealthbox | grep Password:
```

To set your own password when running the container, add `-e PASSWORD=` followed with the password of your choice to
`docker run` command. Alternatively, you can run the container with `-it` flag, and it will ask the password on startup
in the console.

If the container is already running, password can be changed with `boxpasswd` command from shell. (using SSH access,
by opening bash with `docker exec -it stealthbox bash`)

If you both need to keep `-it` flag and generate the password, you can add `-e NONINTERACTIVE=1` to `docker run`
command.

Password is checked with
[cracklib-check](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cracklib), it must be long and strong enough to be accepted.

## Configuration

### Flexget

Flexget is installed in [Daemon](http://flexget.com/wiki/Daemon) mode.

Configuration file is `/home/box/flexget/config.yml`, and will be automatically reloaded in Daemon when changed.

### Open applications inside Pydio

Pydio is able to open files ending with ".url". Thus you can open your apps directly inside the pydio interface.

Example for deluge : Create a file named "deluge.url" in pydio. Right click on it and choose to edit with the text editor.
Add your deluge url inside it : ```web:https://<stealthbox>:<8443>/deluge.```
Save it.
Set "External window" as the default handler for this file.
You can now open deluge by double-clicking on the file "deluge.url".

### Use your own SSL certificate

Self-signed SSL certificate is generated when running the container for the first time. But self-signed certificates
generates warning in browser when trying to connect.

To avoid this warning, you can use a certificate from trusted authority, and load them in StealthBox.
[StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com) can provide free trusted certificate.

- Replacing certificate in container

Your can use your own SSL certificate by replacing `stealthbox.key` and `stealthbox.crt` in `/home/box/ssl/`, using
Pydio or SSH. This will reload web server automatically.

- Using certificate from host

Instead of replacing certificate files in container, you can also load volumes pointing to certificate on the host.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.key:/etc/stealthbox/ssl/stealthbox.key:ro \
  -v /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.crt:/etc/stealthbox/ssl/stealthbox.crt:ro \
  -p 8443:443 -p 8022:22 -p 6881:6881 \
  --restart always \
  --name stealthbox \
  toilal/stealthbox
```

Make sure correct access rights are defined.

```bash
chown 1000:1000 \
  /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.key \
  /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.crt

chmod 400 /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.key
```

### Disable SSL

You may have good reasons to do this, but nginx also listen on `tcp/80` for raw connections. So you can map this port
instead of `tcp/443`.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:80 -p 8022:22 -p 6881:6881 \
  --name stealthbox \
  --restart always \
  toilal/stealthbox
```

Web server will then be available at `http://<stealthbox>:8080`.

### tcp/6881

`tcp/6881` is the port use by Torrent protocol in deluge. You have to map this port on the same host port.

If `tcp/6881` is not available on host, or if you really need to change this port, you have to configure deluge for
port to match, in web UI, or in `/home/box/deluge/core.conf` (`listen_ports` parameter).

*It will be possible to automate this feature after [docker/docker#3778](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3778) issue is implemented.*
